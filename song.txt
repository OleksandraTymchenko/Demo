Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

[Verse 1]
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best
